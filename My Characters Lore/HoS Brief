Summary:
Kairon Orsen Sera arrives under the cover story of a remedial cadet transferred for basic retraining. This is intentional. He is fully capable and does not require instruction.

Directive for HoS:

Treat him publicly as a normal cadet.

Assign routine tasks consistent with that role.

You may use him at full competency only when it will not expose his cover.

Any unusual performance must be dismissed as luck or corrected in front of others.

Note:
Classification level exceeds standard Security clearance. Do not discuss specifics outside Command.
