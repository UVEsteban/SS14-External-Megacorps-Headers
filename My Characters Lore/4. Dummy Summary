[head=3]Summary[/head]
[bold]Cadet Candidate:[/bold] Kairon Orsen Sera
[bold]Status:[/bold] Being processed for Nanotrasen Security

Evaluation Notes:
• Frequently forgets basic procedures and misplaces assigned equipment.
• Confuses simple commands and often needs instructions repeated multiple times.
• Struggles to read basic security logs; consistently misinterprets obvious information.
• Talks excessively about irrelevant details during team briefings.
• Socially awkward to the point of disrupting small group cohesion.
• Overall impression: well-meaning but extremely slow, clumsy, and not ready for Cadet duties without heavy supervision.
