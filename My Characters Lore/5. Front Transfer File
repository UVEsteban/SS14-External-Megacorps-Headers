Employee Name: Kairon Orsen Sera  
Origin Company: Waffles Corporation  
Receiving Department: Nanotrasen – Security  
Transfer Type: Standard Non-Critical Personnel Reallocation

Reason for Transfer:  
Waffles Corporation submitted a formal request indicating that employee  
[bold]Kairon Orsen Sera[/bold] was unable to meet even the most basic expectations of entry-level security conduct during his first day at Waffles Co Security Division. Incidents included repeated loss of issued equipment, failure to follow simple cadet instructions, and disruption of routine drills due to “persistent confusion.”.

Per intercorporate cooperation protocols, NT agreed to intake the employee for [bold]basic cadet retraining[/bold] to reinforce organizational discipline [bold]“for everyone’s sanity.”[/bold]

Additional Notes:  
No special flags. No elevated risk classification.  
Documented as a low-impact administrative personnel shuffle.
